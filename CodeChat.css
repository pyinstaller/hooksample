   CodeChat.css - Style sheet for CodeChat docs
   ********************************************
   Stylesheet for use with CodeChat's extensions to Docutils.

   The overall goal is to allow comments (everything but ``<pre>`` tags) to
   appear with normal (double) spacing, while comments and code are single
   spaced.

   Implementation
   ==============
   This will cause an error if the html4css1 style sheet is embedded instead of
   linked, though the page still displays without problems. However, omitting
   it will cause the linked stylesheet case to fail, so leave this in.

   Also, remove the border so that code and comments mix more naturally.
